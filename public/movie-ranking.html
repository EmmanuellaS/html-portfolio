<h1>Best 3 Movies - Emmanuella's Recommendation</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies Everrrr!</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>So we fight and die or we submit and die.
    I know my choice. I have been sold like a broodmare.
    I've been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.
    Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile?
    Faith. Not in any gods, not in myths and legends, in myself.</p>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>One ring to rule them all.
    One ring to find them.
    One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them!
    He that breaks a thing to find out what it is, has left the path of wisdom.
    Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world.
    Small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.</p>

<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>They can have the world.
    We’ll create our own.
    I’m not letting anyone tell me where to go, what to do, and even who to marry.
    There will never be a king like me.
    Love will find a way, anywhere we go.
    Repeat after me: Hakuna Matata.
    When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
    Out of the ashes of this tragedy, we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era.
    Repeat after me: Hakuna Matata.
    Any story worth telling is worth telling twice.</p>
